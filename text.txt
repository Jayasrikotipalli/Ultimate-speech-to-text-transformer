 Minister Jaishankar, India has more of a multiple-choice mindset, would that be right?
 From non-alignment to all-alignment, for example, you still buy Russian oil. Is that okay with
 your counterpart from the U.S.? Everything is, your relationship is fine, you can do whatever
 you want, whatever you want. Your question, do we have multiple options? The answer is yes.
 Is that a problem? Why should it be a problem? If I'm smart enough to have multiple
 options, you should be admiring me, you know, you shouldn't be criticizing.
 So I agree very much with what Tony said, which is good partners provide choices.
 Smart partners take some of those choices.
